# Tips For LoadBalancer Essence :
#  - give One ExternalIP(
#     cloudProvider create network loadBalancer with ip automatically/
#     create manually from CloudProvider and linked in the Object Definition/
#     install metal-lb and create network loadBalancer with IP for development purpose
#    )
#  - balance traffic among side of the pods (same as NodePort)
#  - internally it's create NodePort
#  - just select one service whereas ingress select as many as want.
#  - loadBalancer is pretty much like NodePort just it create network loadBalancer edition to convert port achieved
#    from the NodePort(30000-32767) to 80 with new IP address
#  - for each loadBalancer that created should payed to cloud Provider
